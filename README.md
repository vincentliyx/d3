# Simplify D3

This is a simple modified version of **D3.js**. The source code is forked from mbostock's [D3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) which is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.

The purpose of this modification is minimizing the size of the library (from 240KB to ~80KB). This library only contain the basic function of D3.js.

Removed modules:
**behavior**, 
**dsv**, 
**geo**, 
**geom**, 
**layout**, 
**time** 

API of complete D3.js [See the wiki.](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki)

example of D3.js [see the gallery](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery) and [mbostockâ€™s bl.ocks](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock).
